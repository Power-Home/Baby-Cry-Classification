<br>
Baby cry classification/detection as well as emotion detection are the three main application of baby cry detection, which actually is a necessary pre-processing step for many subsequent analysis.

This project is pre-research of Philips Baby Monitor project(not relevant to the core but may motivate you). Here we are trying to implement CNN to classify four kinds of sounds including baby cry and other similar sounds such as moan, based on the given audio data collected with annotated labels.
